===================
ms3 Quick Reference
===================

This page is a quick guide for using ms3 for different tasks. It supposes you are working in an interactive Python
interpreter such as IPython, Jupyter, Google Colab, or just the console.

Parsing a single score
======================

Locate the `MuseScore 3 <https://musescore.org/en/download>`__ score you want to parse and make sure it is uncompressed,
i.e. it has the extension ``.mscx`` and not ``.mscz``.

.. tip::

    MSCZ files are ZIP files containing the uncompressed MSCX. A later version of ms3 will be able to deal with MSCZ, too.
