  abstract = {A survey of intellectual currents in the philosophy of knowledge and research methodology is given. This survey provides the backdrop for taking stock of the methodological differences that have arisen between disciplines, such as the methods commonly used in science, history or literary theory. Postmodernism and scientific empiricism are described and portrayed as two sides of the same coin we call skepticism. It is proposed that the choice of methodological approach for any given research program is guided by moral and esthetic considerations. Careful assessment of these risks may suggest choosing an unorthodox method, such as quantitative methods in history, or deconstruction in science. It is argued that methodological tools (such as Ockham's razor) should not be mistaken for philosophical world-views. The article advocates a broadening of methodological education in both arts and sciences disciplines. In particular, it advocates and defends the use of quantitative empirical methodology in various areas of music scholarship.},
